# 6 Degrees / Casual Critters Game

These two fully prototyped games are the result of 12 weeks of work from 12 students at BGNlab during the summer of 2017. The aim of these games was to see if player behaviour and attitude toward climate change could be influenced by video games, either casual or narrative-based.

## Install Instructions
1. Have Construct 2 (paid version only, as we use certain features unusable by free versions).
2. Open the 6Degrees.caproj in Construct 2
3. Enjoy.

## Build Instructions
1. Copy and paste either the Casual or Story app icons (depending on which game you want) into 6Degrees/Files, replacing the previous files.
2. Open Construct2
3. Go to the event sheet "GG Scores and Levels"
4. Set the global constant "GG_GAME_VERSION" to either "CASUAL" or "STORY", depending on which game you want to build.
5. Set the global constant "GG_DEBGU" to either 0 or 1, depending on if you want debug settings in your build.
6. Click on the project name (located at the top of the "Projects" pane) and look at the properties bar. Set the appropriate name, version, description, and ID.
7. Set the first layout to either "C6 Casual" for the casual game or "Opening" for the story game
8. Now you can export the game to anywhere you please

It is important that you don't save, or at the very least, commit any build-setting related changes to the repository.
